                            <p>"Blood runs through the streets of every major city. The cries of innocent people
                            ring out into the night, piercing through the monotonous drone of roaming bodies
                            dragging themselves across the land. Food is scarce and hope is a dying luxury, and yet you're here. If you're expecting some kind of special treatment, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everyone at Camp Still Alive pulls their own weight. If you wish to live in the safest spot for over a hundred miles, I suggest you do the same. Zombies aren't picky, so we have to be. Living as a citizen of the camp has it's perks: 3 square meals per day, a large feast once per month, and a monthly ration of the camp's bullet supply. If you're still interested in joining Camp Still ALive, have a look at the Commander's Bulletin. I'm sure you'll find some useful information there. Hopefully I'll see you again as a recruit."</p>

                                    <p class="bulletinBody">Let me just start out by saying: Thank you for taking an interest in STILL ALIVE! This idea has been in the works for quite some time and we (The Game Runners) are extremely happy to finally see it becoming what it was always meant to. We started this project in late 2014 and have been building on it ever since. We began beta-testing in 2016 and hope to release our story upon the world in summer, 2017. For those who are uninformed, Still Alive is a Live Action Role-Playing (LARP) game, taking place in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to survive all of the challenges of a zombie apocalypse alongside all of the other survivors at the base camp (Aptly named: Still Alive). You'll face hardships, tough moral decisions, hordes of zombies, and more!<br><br>
                                    Our game is for mature players only and thus players are required to be 18 years of age or older. With parental consent, players may be as young as 16 so long as they follow ALL of the rules for Minors (found in the Still Alive Handbook: page 4). Anyone under the age of 16 will not be allowed to play - no exceptions.</p>
